# Huggingmolecules

We envision large-scale pretrained models to become the backbone of drug discovery and other applications of AI to chemistry. This repository aims to give easy access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

## Available models

* MAT
* Grover

## Baselines

We also include the following baselines.

* Chemprop
