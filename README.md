# Huggingmolecules

We envision models that are pretrained a vast range of domain-relevant tasks to become the backbone of drug discovery, and in the long run other applications of predictive modeling to chemistry. This repository aims to further this vision and give easy access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

## Available models

* MAT
* Grover

## Baselines

We also include the following baselines.

* Chemprop
